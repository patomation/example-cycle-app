# Cycle.js workshop

## Welcome!

Don't get stuck! Any issuesâ€”please ask right away!

Let's jam!

## A short list of pre-requisites

1. Node.js:
   * I suggest installing Node.js using [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs). See the readme for easy installation instructions.
   * Let's all use Node.js v10.9.0 for consistency.
   * Activate a Node.js version in your shell by running `nvs` and selecting the correct version.
1. Make sure you have the latest version of npm, by running `npm --global install npm`
1. Use an editor that has excellent TypeScript support. I recommend the free, open source and terribly popular [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (quick and easy installation).
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


## The example Cycle.js project

1. `git clone https://github.com/mightyiam/example-cycle-app.git`
1. `cd example-cycle-app`
1. `npm install` to install the dependencies

Now you can:

* `npm run serve` to start a development server. Navigate to the printed URL.
* `npm run test` to run the included test.
* `code .` to run the VS Code editor in the project, if you will.
